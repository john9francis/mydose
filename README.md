# Overview

{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.}

MyDose is an app for cancer patients and their doctors to keep track of how much radiation they receive in their treatments. 

To start the app, open up a command prompt and go to the first "mysite" directory (it contains a file named 'manage.py'). Run the following code to start a test webserver:

```powershell
py manage.py runserver
```

Then, open a web browser and go to (localhost:800/mydose). This should show you the app's homepage. From there you can choose to log in as a doctor or a patient. 

To try out the functionality, use the username: 'admin' and the password: 'password'

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
